      <p class="no-indent">
        &ldquo;Every student has unique needs, and it is our obligation to foster an environment where they are afforded an education tailored to them. Massachusetts’ education system is the best in the nation, and I believe that this legislation will enhance our standing while ensuring that education is, indeed, the great equalizer.&rdquo;

      <div class="pullquote">
        Immigrant Students in Massachusetts
      </div>

      <p>
      As one of the first British colonies in North America, Massachusetts has a long history of immigration. Today, immigrants in Massachusetts make up roughly one-fifth of the the labor force, working in nearly every industry and making tremendous contributions to the state’s economy (<a href “https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/immigrants-in-massachusetts”> American Immigration Council</a>). And while many immigrants come to the U.S. as adults, there is also a significant population of immigrant children who are students in the state’s public school system. Much of these children’s success as newcomers in this country lies in the hands of their schools, and for more than 90,00 students in Massachusetts classified English Language Learners (ELL), their academic success depends on school programs targeted to increase their English proficiency  (<a href “https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/11/15/mass-house-approves-bilingual-education/wjlTjinQk6WU4RO7ySCyFM/story.html” >Boston Globe</a>).

      </p>

      <p>
        But ELL students face significant difficulties and much higher dropout rates than domestic students&mdash;while only about 1 in 1o Massachusetts students is an English Language Learner, these students make up 1 in 5 high school dropouts in the state (<a href =
"http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/selectedpopulations.aspx">Massachusetts Dept. of Education</a>, <a href = "http://www.bostonmagazine.com/education/2017/11/16/bilingual-education-massachusetts/"> Boston Magazine</a>). For newcomer students arriving in a new school in a new country, the transition can be difficult and uncomfortable. I spoke to some students in an ELL program at Charlestown High School in Boston about their experiences transitioning to an English speaking school and they reported that it was very hard at first. A student named Arlay from the Dominican Republic told me that he felt strangely because nobody understood him. Another Dominican student, Angel, told me that the transition was difficult, not only because he came to the school without knowing anybody, but also because he couldn’t understand his teachers. Not being able to understand teachers was also difficulty for a Chinese student Jiahon, who was frustrated because in classes like biology, physics, and math, he felt he had often already learned the material in China, but couldn’t do well in class because he couldn’t understand the questions. These feelings were echoed by other students and are experienced by immigrant students all around the country.

     </p>

     <p>
      However, in Massachusetts, this difficult transition might be softened by a promising new law permitting bilingual education in the state. This new law, House Bill 4032, also called the LOOK Bill, is an amendment and repeal of the provisions of a  2002 law known as Question 2, which required that &ldquo;all public school children must be taught English by being taught all subjects in English and being placed in English language classrooms.&ldquo; Question 2 was a ballot initiative that 61% of voters voted in favor of (<a href =
"https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_English_in_Public_Schools_Initiative,_Question_2_(2002)"> Ballotopedia</a>), but when the LOOK Bill repealing the provisions of Question 2 passed in November 2017, it was almost unanimously supported,  opposed by only one member of the Massachusetts state legislature (<a href = "http://www.bostonmagazine.com/education/2017/11/16/bilingual-education-massachusetts/">Boston Magazine</a>). So what has changed in public opinion since 2002 to cause this overwhelming support? Perhaps it’s because with more than twice the number of ELL students in Massachusetts in more districts than in 2002 (<a href =
"http://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/08/09/english-language-learning-bills"> WBUR</a>), more citizens across the state are conscious of  the immigrant student population. Caitlyn Castillejo, a Sheltered English Immersion (SEI) teacher of ELL students at Charlestown High, thinks that the shift in public opinion is in part a reflection of the changing pedagogical theory surrounding second language acquisition. Much of the current research in the field suggests that strong proficiency in native language results not only in stronger ability to learn a second language, but also boosts students self confidence and cultural pride (<a href =
"https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/05/13/bilingual-students-need-support-in-their-native.html">Education Week</a>).


      <div class="pullquote">
        The New Law: Student's Perspectives
      </div>

      <p>
        With the new bilingual education law, students in Massachusetts can be instructed in both English and their native language and can receive content instruction in their native language in classes like science, math, and social studies (<a href =
"http://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/08/09/english-language-learning-bills">WBUR</a>). This would help students like Jiahon who might know the content but cannot understand the questions their teachers are asking them. However, some of the Charlestown SEI students I talked to were hesitant about the new law because they thought that too much native language instruction would hinder their ability to learn English. Though Jiahon thought it would be useful to have teachers who speak Chinese he said that &ldquo;for ESL class, we need to [have] just a little bit [of] Chinese, not too much Chinese, because if you have too much [instruction in Chinese] for many people, if you don’t have the translation, you don’t know what it means, so everytime you need [a translator].&rdquo; Another student, William, also from China, said that he would like to have a little bit of instruction in Chinese but not too much, &ldquo;because this is a new country and I need to learn more of this country’s language.&rdquo; Angel, who was in a bilingual program last year and is now in an SEI program, says he likes his new class better &ldquo;because I can speak more English, I can practice with my friends, because the last year was almost always Spanish so I can express something in English now, I’m learning a lot. &rdquo;
      </p>

            <p>
      However, for the most part, students seemed receptive to the idea of having dual-language classes in both English and their native language. Many felt that it would be easier for them to do their work if they were able to understand what was going on in class more through native language instruction. Some students also told me that they would like to take classes in their native language to maintain their home culture. A Dominican student named Yasmin told me she wanted to learn more spanish to &ldquo;por tener más la autonomia bien,&rdquo; which means to maintain one’s autonomy and sense of self. Other students said they would want to study in their native language so that they could still communicate fluently with family members or return to their home country with fluency.


       </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        Teacher's Opinions on the LOOK Bill
      </div>

      <p>
        The teachers I spoke with at Charlestown are strong believers in bilingual education, but think that Massachusetts will have difficulties implementing the new law, particularly in finding enough teachers with strong enough fluency and formal education in the languages students speak to teach bilingual classes. Askahta Kadagathur, a student teacher in an SEI class told me that &ldquo;the principle of this law is something that I really deeply believe in because I think what it’s saying is that it’s acknowledging that students will be more successful when the schools understand the cultures that they’re coming from and the schools make an effort to support multiculturalism...[however,] practically speaking it’s gonna be really hard to find enough teachers who aren’t just able to use the language for informal translation, but who are actually literate in that language in order do proper bilingual instruction.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This will indeed be difficult considering Charlestown, a school with a relative high portion of multilingual teachers, already has a difficult time providing instruction for students with teachers who speak their language. Ms.Castillejo, the SEI teacher who mentors Ms. Kadagathur, explained that though the school has a large population of Chinese speaking students, with only eight teachers in the building who speak Chinese, due to scheduling constraints many Chinese students go without ever having a teacher who speaks their language. The students in the SEI class that I worked with at Charlestown were all either Spanish or Chinese speakers, but BPS also has large populations of students speaking Haitian creole, Cape Verdean creole, Portuguese, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Somali,  languages for which there are even fewer teachers qualified to teach in (<a href =
"https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib07/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/238/BPS%20at%20a%20Glance%2014-0502.pdf">Boston Public Schools</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    One downside of bilingual programs compared to SEI programs is that while in an SEI classroom you will probably hear students speaking a potpourri of languages, bilingual programs almost certainly require that students separate by language, with students of different native languages in different bilingual classrooms of English and their language. Ms. Castillejo thinks that with students separated by language, schools would &ldquo;lose the cross-cultural connections&rdquo; that SEI programs foster.  This saddens me also, as I was happy to observe in Ms. Castillejo’s class Spanish and Chinese speaking students laughing and joking with each other, and teaching each other words and phrases in their languages.
  </p>

  <p>
Even with the new law in place, the teachers I spoke to don’t think the program for English Language Learners at Charlestown will change very much. After all, the new law doesn’t mandate bilingual education, it just permits it, and Charlestown is pretty happy with their SEI program. One thing that Ms. Castillejo and Ms. Kadagathur hope the new law will change for their students is that the school would offer more native language classes so that students can study the history, literature, and culture of their native countries, in their native language. This is something that many of the students I interviewed expressed interest in, and is one of the many possible benefits that the new law offers.
